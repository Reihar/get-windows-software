Download link repository for common free (as in free beer) windows software.

Why? Because everytime I have to use Windows, installaling sofware is a chore, so I've decided to make a list.

###Flash

It is pretty hard to find the full installers for flash player. They are not directly linked on the download page : you need to search through the help to find them or else you will download a downloader (which requires an Internet connection) that will download and install flash.
